# Javascript-Quiz-HW4

I was tasked with creating a JavaScript quiz that would, increment the score when a question was answered correctly, and decrement the time when a wrong answer was chosen. After the quiz is finished, I added an input box that asked the user for their initials and using local storage I then saved the score and initials to a scoreboard. To accomplish this task, I erased all data on my page each time I wanted to display a new question or score. I used JavaScript to create everything I wanted my quiz to display, and the buttons I used to navigate through the game itself. I also used JavaScript to implement a timer.

technologies used:
HTML, 
CSS,
JAVASCRIPT
